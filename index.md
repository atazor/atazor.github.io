#### Cybersecurity
I started working full time in cybersecurity in 2008. Prior to that, I learned a little bit of web development. In the last three years, I have been working to become an expert cyber threat hunting. 
#### What is cyber threat hunting?
"The process of proactively and iteratively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions."
The SANS Institute authors expand on the cyber threat hunting process, calling it an active defense strategy consisting of:

* Intelligence: The process of collecting data, turning the data into usable information, analyzing the potentially competing
* Offense: The countermeasures organizations may take to defend against cyberattacks, in particular Advanced Persistent Threats (APT).

The SANS Institute white paper, says it best, "What is powerful about threat hunting is that it pits human defenders against human adversaries. The key is to find the right analysts and empower them."
